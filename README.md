# Various resources on programming I have collected over the years
These files are the subset of my private repository `ninnroot/notes` where I store all my notes regarding every aspect of my life. These are the ones I would like to share with the public for the benefit of my fellow engineers. 

When working on a new project, there are always new challenges. I like to document them for the purpose of future reference.
